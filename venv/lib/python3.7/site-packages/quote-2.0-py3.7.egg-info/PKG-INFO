        #### About
        
        quote is a python wrapper for the Goodreads Quote API, powered by [gazpacho](https://github.com/maxhumber/gazpacho).
        
        
        
        #### Usage
        
        quote is simple to use:
        
        ```python
        from quote import quote
        
        search = 'Jasper Fforde'
        result = quote(search, limit=2)
        print(result)
        
        # [{'author': 'Jasper Fforde',
        #   'book': 'Something Rotten',
        #   'quote': 'If the real world were a book, it would never find a publisher. Overlong, detailed to the point of distraction-and ultimately, without a major resolution.'},
        #  {'author': 'Jasper Fforde',
        #   'book': 'The Well of Lost Plots',
        #   'quote': "After all, reading is arguably a far more creative and imaginative process than writing; when the reader creates emotion in their head, or the colors of the sky during the setting sun, or the smell of a warm summer's breeze on their face, they should reserve as much praise for themselves as they do for the writer - perhaps more."}]
        ```
        
        quote can also be used as a command line tool:
        
        ```
        >>> max@mbp$ quote 'alain de botton'
        People only get really interesting when they start to rattle the bars of their cages.
        
        >>> max@mbp$ quote --search='alain de botton'
        Intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone - and finding that that's ok with them.
        ```
        
        
        
        #### Installation
        
        ```
        pip install -U quote
        ```
